Event Sales App (by Shalltell Flores)
Our group plans on working on a text-based program for event sales. Users can view
events and buy tickets. Admin or event owner can add events and check sales.

Planned Functionality
- User can view events and can choose an event to purchase tickets for; they can
view purchased tickets
- Admin can view, add or delete events; edit events to change quantity/add more
seats, set ticket prices, and view available quantities left; view total sales and
how much they’ve sold in total
- The system is text-based and allows users and admins to use a menu for
choosing what action they want to take
- A selection of default events will be loaded in via text file input
- We will validate input and do throw/exception handling
